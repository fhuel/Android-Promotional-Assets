Android-Promotional-Assets
==========================

A Collection of Graphical Assets for the Android Playstore

As very well explained on http://xayin.com/thisisatest.html

    • Smartphone Screenshots (at least 2): 320x480, 480x800, 480x854 . JPEG or 24bit PNG (no alpha)
    • Tablet Screenshots (at least 2, as many as 8 for both 7 inch and 8 for 10 inch screens): 2560x1600, 1280x800 . JPEG or 24bit PNG (no alpha)
    • A high resolution application icon: 512 x 512, 32bit PNG , MAX 1024KB
    • A promotional graphic: 180w x 120h, JPG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha)
    • A feature graphic: 1024w x 500h, JPEG or 24bit PNG (no alpha). Better to use a safe frame of 924x400

The test graphics are from the xayin.com as well, they made a great work publishing a test app to see exactly how the assets get cropped and resized in all the different contexts.
You can find the test application at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xayin.android.thisisatest




Notes:

You can also add a promotional YouTube video to Google Play by entering a URL in the relative field. While a Promo Video is not required, it is highly recommended as a fun, engaging way to show your potential users the features of your app.
The Video should be 30 seconds to 2 minutes long. You can record directly from the device [ http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html#screenrecord ]
