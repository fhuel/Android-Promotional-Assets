Android-Promotional-Assets
==========================

A Collection of Graphical Assets for the Android Playstore

As very well explained on http://xayin.com/thisisatest.html
  
    • Screenshots (at least 2): 320w x 480h, 480w x 800h, 480w x 854h (+ tablet-specific sizes).
    • A high resolution application icon: 512 x 512.
    • A promotional graphic: 180w x 120h.
    • A feature graphic: 1024w x 500h.
    
The test graphics are from the xayin.com as well, they made a great work publishing a test app to see exactly how the assets get cropped and resized in all the different contexts.
You can find the test application at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xayin.android.thisisatest
